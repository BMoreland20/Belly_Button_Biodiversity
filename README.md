This week's challenge we aimed to create a front-end page that examined bacteria biomes in human belly buttons.  The aim after the front-end was successfully developed is to convert the .js file to a github pages webpage.

Ensured that an image was added to jumbotron, changed background color and font color, and ensured that the webpage was mobile-respnsive.

All of this accumulated to the final end result in a functioning webpage.
